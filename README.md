# project-euler
My attempt to solve the problems on projecteuler.net

All 'originalSolution' methods are the form of the code used to first produce the correct answer (i.e. any subesquent optimisations are recorded in the improvedSolution method). Any utility methods being used in an originalSolution were coded either for that solution or for a previous solution.
